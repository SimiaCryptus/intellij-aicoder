# String_Calculator

In this test we will used AI Coding Assistant to implement the String_Calculator class to solve the following problem:

```
[Create a utility function to find all simple addition expressions in a string and replace them with the calculated result., Create a utility function to find all simple multiplication expressions in a string and replace them with the calculated result, Implement a utility function to interpret simple math expressions., Implement a static main method that tests each class member and validates the output.]
```

## Implementation

The first step is to translate the problem into code. We can do this by using the "Insert Implementation" command.
