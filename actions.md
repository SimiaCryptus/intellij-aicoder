# Plaintext Actions

Plaintext actions provide text processing features for any language. The following actions are available for plaintext
in the AI Coder plugin:

| Text             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Redo Last        | The `Redo Last` action allows you to quickly redo the last action you performed. This is useful for getting variations from the generative AI. For example, if you generate something and want to see an alternate, you can use the `Redo Last` action to quickly retry without having to start from scratch.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Replace Options  | The `Replace Options` action allows you to quickly replace selected text with one of a set of suggested options. This also captures some preceding and following context, but uses a different prompting method to suggest the options. For example, if you type ‘I had a day’ and place the cursor after 'a' and then use the `Replace Options` action, the plugin will **_provide an interactive selection UI_** to suggest words like ‘great’, ‘bad’, or ‘delicious’. |
