Alex: Alright, let's do this! For the city!

## Scene 7 - The T-Rex Encounter

The children and Robo come face to face with a T-Rex. They must figure out how to distract it and lure it away from the
city.

Setting: City streets

Alex: We need a plan to distract the T-Rex and lure it away from the city.

Sara: I have an idea. We can create a trail of meat and lead it away from the city.

Max: That might work. But how do we get the T-Rex to follow the trail?

Robo: I can use my speakers to create the sound of other dinosaurs. The T-Rex will think there are more dinosaurs and
follow the sound.

Alex: Great idea, Robo! Let's get to work.

## Scene 8 - The Robot's Sacrifice

Robo sacrifices himself to save the children from the rampaging dinosaurs. The children mourn his loss and vow to stop
the dinosaurs once and for all.

Setting: City streets

Alex: We need to figure out a way to stop the dinosaurs before they cause any more destruction.

Sara: Agreed. But how do we do that?

Max: We need to find the machine that brought the dinosaurs back to life and shut it off.

Robo: I can help you locate the machine. But it's dangerous. We need to be careful.

Alex: We're with you, Robo. Let's save the city!

# Act 3 - Team Up

The children team up with Robo to figure out how to stop the dinosaurs and save the city.

## Scene 9 - The Plan

The children and Robo come up with a plan to send the dinosaurs back in time.

Setting: Laboratory

Alex: So, Robo, do you have any ideas on how we can send the dinosaurs back in time?

Robo: Yes, I do. We need to use the time machine located in the basement of this laboratory. It can send the dinosaurs
back to their own time period.

Sara: Great! But how do we get to the time machine? Isn't it dangerous down there?

Max: Don't worry, we can handle it. We'll need to use some of the gadgets from your tool belt, Robo, to get through any
obstacles.

Robo: Good thinking, Max. I have just the tools we need. Let's get going and save the city!

## Scene 10 - The Time Machine

The children and Robo find the time machine and begin to figure out how to use it.

Setting: Laboratory

Robo: This way, everyone. The time machine is just ahead.

Alex: How does the time machine work, Robo?

Robo: It's a complicated process, but I can explain it. We need to input the exact time period that we want the
dinosaurs to go back to, and then activate the machine. The machine will create a wormhole that will transport the
dinosaurs back in time.

Sara: How do we know what time period to send them to?

Robo: We need to calculate the time period based on the age of the dinosaurs and the geological era they lived in.
Luckily, I have all the data we need in my memory banks.

Max: Alright, let's get to work. We need to save the city!

## Scene 11 - Calculations

Sara uses her math skills to calculate the exact time and place to send the dinosaurs back to.

Setting: Laboratory

Sara: Okay, I've calculated the exact time and place to send the dinosaurs back to. We need to input the values into the
time machine and activate it.

Robo: Great job, Sara! I'll input the values while you all stand back.

Max: What will happen to the dinosaurs once they go back in time?

Robo: They will be transported to the exact time and location that we input into the machine. They will be safe and
won't cause any more damage to the city.

Alex: Alright, let's do it! We need to save the city!

## Scene 12 - The Final Battle

The children and Robo use the time machine to send the dinosaurs back to their own time. They must fight off the
remaining dinosaurs to make sure they all go through the time portal.

Setting: City streets

Alex: We need to take out the remaining dinosaurs before we send them back in time!

Sara: I have an idea! We can use the time portal to strategically transport the dinosaurs to different locations so they
won't cause any more destruction.

Max: I'll distract the dinosaurs while you guys use the time portal!

Robo: I'll help you, Max! Let's lead them away from the city!

Alex: Great plan, guys! Let's do this!

Sara: Okay, I'll input the values for the time portal. Everyone stand back!

Robo: I'll make sure the dinosaurs are in the right position before we activate the portal.

Max: They're getting closer! Hurry, Sara!

Alex: Almost there! We just need to hold them off a little longer!

Sara: Got it! Activating the portal now!

## Scene 13 - The Aftermath

The children and Robo survey the damage caused by the rampaging dinosaurs. They are relieved to see that the city is
safe once again.

Setting: City streets

Alex: Wow, that was intense! I can't believe we actually did it!

## Scene 14 - Calculations

The children and Robo work together to figure out the calculations needed to send the dinosaurs back in time.

Setting: Laboratory control room

Sara: Okay, so we need to calculate the exact time and location of the dinosaurs' original habitat to send them back in
time.

Alex: But how do we do that? We don't even know what era they're from!

Robo: Based on the DNA analysis, I can determine that they are from the late Cretaceous period, approximately 65 million
years ago.

Max: Okay, so how do we figure out the location?

Sara: We can use the geological data from that time period to determine the location of their habitat.

Robo: I have access to the necessary data. We need to calculate the exact coordinates of the dinosaurs' habitat and the
time period in which they lived.

Alex: Okay, let's get to work then. We can use our math skills to figure this out!

## Scene 15 - The Time Machine

The children and Robo locate the time machine and prepare to send the dinosaurs back in time.

Setting: Laboratory

Sara: We need to enter the calculated coordinates and time period into the time machine to send the dinosaurs back in
time.

Max: But how do we know it will work?

Robo: The machine is designed to send objects back in time. As long as we input the correct coordinates and time period,
it should work.

Alex: Alright, let's do this!

Robo: I'll enter the coordinates and time period into the machine. Stand back, everyone.

Sara: Good luck, Robo!

Robo: Initiating time travel sequence now.

Max: Here we go!

## Scene 16 - Sending the Dinosaurs Back
