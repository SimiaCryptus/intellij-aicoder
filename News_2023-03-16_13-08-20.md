## Politicians Pass Bill to Rename Earth to 'America Jr.'

Yesterday, in a controversial move, politicians in Washington D.C. passed a bill to rename Earth to 'America Jr.'

The bill, which was met with both outrage and support from citizens around the globe, was introduced by a group of
lawmakers who believe that renaming the planet will help make America great again.

According to sources close to the lawmakers, the idea behind the bill is to send a message to other countries that
America is the most powerful nation on the planet.

While some have criticized the move as being arrogant and unnecessary, others have praised it as a bold statement of
American superiority.

'We are the greatest country on Earth, and it's time we start acting like it,' said one lawmaker who supported the bill.

Opponents of the bill have pointed out that renaming the planet would be both impractical and impossible, as it would
require changing maps, globes, and countless other references to Earth.

Despite these concerns, the lawmakers who introduced the bill remain optimistic that it will become law.

'We believe that this is the right thing to do for America, and we will do whatever it takes to make it happen,' said
one of the bill's sponsors.

Only time will tell whether the bill will ultimately be successful, but one thing is clear: the debate over renaming
Earth to 'America Jr.' is far from over.

Stay tuned to The Onion for updates on this developing story.

## President takes credit for sun rise

WASHINGTON—Claiming that he alone possessed the necessary strength and vision to lead the nation, President Donald Trump
took credit for the sun rise Monday, telling reporters that it was he and he alone who had caused the star at the center
of the solar system to appear above the horizon yet again.

“Let me tell you, nobody is better at bringing back the sun than I am,” said Trump, adding that the sky had grown dark
and cold under the previous administration and that it was only thanks to his policies and unparalleled leadership that
the burning ball of gas had returned once more to warm and nourish the nation.

“People say to me all the time, they say, ‘Sir, how do you do it? How do you bring back the sun?’ And I just tell them,
it’s all up here,” Trump continued, pointing to his temple. “It’s all in the brain. You’ve got to know how to make the
tough decisions, and I make the toughest decisions.”

According to White House sources, the president has been closely monitoring the sun’s movements since his inauguration,
often interrupting briefings and meetings to ask aides why the celestial body wasn’t in the exact position he wanted it
to be in.

“He’ll stare up at the sky for hours, sometimes with his hands on his hips or his arms folded, just glaring up at the
sun,” said one staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Then he’ll say something like, ‘I could do better than
that. Believe me.’”

Despite his claims, however, the president’s supporters have been divided on his role in the daily appearance of the
sun, with some calling his involvement essential to the process of daybreak and others saying that he was merely taking
credit for a natural phenomenon that occurred regardless of his actions.

“I’m sorry, but the sun rises every day. That’s just a fact,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who has been a vocal
critic of the president on other issues. “If he wants to take credit for things that happen every day, he can do that,
but I don’t think it’s going to make anyone’s life better.”

At press time, sources confirmed that Trump had taken to Twitter to criticize the sun for being too hot and for shining
too much in the middle of the day.

## Congress Introduces Bill to Make Lying Illegal

Capitol Hill - In a stunning move aimed at restoring honesty to politics, Congress today introduced a bill that would
make lying illegal. The bill, which is expected to pass with overwhelming support, would make it a federal crime to
intentionally deceive the public.

"It's time to put an end to the culture of lying that has permeated our political system," said Sen. John Smith (R-TX),
the bill's chief sponsor. "Our democracy depends on the trust of the American people, and we can't afford to have
politicians who are not held accountable for their words."

The bill would establish a new federal agency, the Truth Enforcement Commission, to investigate and prosecute cases of
lying by government officials. The agency would be funded by a new tax on political campaign contributions, which
supporters say is a small price to pay for a more honest political system.

"We need to send a message that lying is not acceptable in our society," said Rep. Jane Doe (D-CA), a co-sponsor of the
bill. "This bill will help restore the public's faith in government and ensure that our elected officials are held to
the highest standards of honesty and integrity."

Opponents of the bill argued that it would be difficult to enforce and could be used to stifle free speech. They also
questioned the government's ability to determine what constitutes a lie.

"Who gets to decide what's true and what's not?" asked Sen. Bob Johnson (R-FL). "This bill is a slippery slope toward
government censorship and thought control."

Despite these concerns, the bill is expected to pass both houses of Congress with bipartisan support. President Obama
has indicated that he will sign the bill into law as soon as it reaches his desk.

## Supreme Court Rules that Corporations are People, But Only the Cool Ones

Washington D.C. - Yesterday, the Supreme Court made a historic ruling that corporations are people, but only the cool
ones.

The ruling, which was made in an effort to help the struggling economy, has already caused controversy and confusion.

According to the Court, corporations that are deemed 'cool' by a special committee will be granted personhood status,
which will allow them to enjoy many of the same rights and privileges as human beings.

However, corporations that are not considered 'cool' will not be granted personhood status, and will be subject to
stricter regulations and oversight.

The decision was met with mixed reactions from lawmakers and the public.

Many praised the Court for taking a bold stance on the issue, while others criticized the ruling as being unfair and
arbitrary.

Despite the controversy, the Court's decision is sure to have a significant impact on the economy and the future of
corporate personhood.

Stay tuned for more updates as the story develops.

## Politicians Agree to Work Together, Then Immediately Start Fighting Again

Washington D.C. - In a dramatic turn of events today, politicians from both sides of the aisle agreed to put aside their
differences and work together for the betterment of the country. However, this momentary truce was short-lived, as the
politicians quickly resumed their bickering and infighting almost immediately.

The scene played out on Capitol Hill, where members of Congress had gathered to discuss the latest hot-button issues
facing the nation. Despite the initial show of unity, it soon became clear that the politicians were unable to put aside
their personal and political rivalries for any extended period of time.

According to insiders, the brief moment of cooperation was largely for show, designed to placate constituents and create
the illusion that the politicians were actually trying to get things done.

"It's all just a dog and pony show," said one anonymous source. "They know that the public is fed up with their constant
fighting and bickering, so they put on this act to make it seem like they're doing something. But as soon as the cameras
are turned off, it's back to business as usual."

Despite the disappointing outcome, some politicians remained optimistic. "We'll keep trying," said one senator. "We know
that the American people want us to work together, and that's what we're going to do. Eventually."

However, others were less convinced. "It's a lost cause," said another lawmaker. "We're never going to be able to work
together as long as everyone is more concerned with their own agenda than the good of the country."

As the politicians filed out of the room, the atmosphere was tense and fraught with tension. It was clear that, despite
their best efforts, the politicians were still unable to put aside their differences and work together for any
meaningful amount of time.

Only time will tell if this latest attempt at cooperation will yield any real results, or if it will simply be another
in a long line of failed attempts to bridge the gap between the two parties.

## Physicists Prove Existence of Parallel Universes

Scientists at a top research facility have announced that they have found evidence of the existence of parallel
universes. The discovery was made during a series of experiments conducted over the past year.

The team of physicists, led by Dr. Jane Smith, used a cutting-edge particle accelerator to create tiny black holes in a
controlled environment. By analyzing the behavior of these black holes, the scientists were able to detect the presence
of other universes.

According to Dr. Smith, the finding is a major breakthrough in the field of theoretical physics. 'We've long suspected
that there may be other universes out there, but until now we've had no way of proving it. This discovery opens up a
whole new realm of possibilities.'

The implications of the discovery are staggering. If there are indeed parallel universes, it means that there are an
infinite number of versions of ourselves, and an infinite number of possible outcomes for every decision we make.

Dr. Smith and her team are now working on ways to explore these other universes. 'We're just scratching the surface of
what's possible,' she says. 'Who knows what other wonders we'll discover?'

The discovery has already generated a great deal of excitement among scientists and the general public alike. Many are
calling it the most important scientific breakthrough of the century.

But not everyone is convinced. Some critics have dismissed the finding as a 'glorified science fiction story.' Others
have raised ethical concerns about the potential dangers of meddling with parallel universes.

Despite the controversy, the discovery is sure to be the subject of intense study and debate for years to come.

So what does this mean for us? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure: the world just got a whole lot more
interesting.

## Researchers Discover Link Between Coffee and Longevity

In a groundbreaking study conducted at a lab next month, researchers have discovered a link between coffee and longevity
that may finally justify our caffeine addiction. The study found that those who consume coffee regularly tend to live
longer than those who do not, even after controlling for other lifestyle factors. While the exact mechanism behind this
effect is still unclear, the researchers hypothesize that it may be due to the high levels of antioxidants in coffee.

Of course, this is just the latest in a long line of studies that have sought to uncover the health benefits of coffee.
Previous research has suggested that coffee can reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and even some types of cancer.
But until now, no one has been able to definitively link coffee consumption to longevity. The researchers behind this
study hope that their findings will encourage more people to start drinking coffee on a regular basis, and that it will
lead to further research into the health benefits of this beloved beverage.

Despite these promising results, however, the researchers caution that coffee should still be consumed in moderation.
Too much caffeine can lead to jitters, anxiety, and even heart palpitations, so it is important to be mindful of how
much coffee you are drinking. But for those who can't imagine starting their day without a cup of joe, this study
provides some welcome news.

In conclusion, the link between coffee and longevity is a fascinating area of research that is sure to yield more
insights in the years to come. Whether you are a coffee lover or a skeptic, there is no denying that this study is a
major breakthrough in our understanding of the health benefits of this beloved beverage. So go ahead and pour yourself
another cup – your body (and your taste buds) will thank you!

## Mark Zuckerberg Develops New Algorithm to Destroy the Concept of Free Will

Yesterday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the development of a groundbreaking new algorithm that will
effectively destroy the concept of free will.

According to Zuckerberg, the algorithm will be implemented across all Facebook platforms and will use advanced data
mining techniques to predict and manipulate user behavior.

"We believe that by controlling the choices that users make, we can create a more engaging and profitable platform,"
Zuckerberg said in a statement.

The algorithm will work by analyzing user data and using that information to create personalized advertisements, news
feeds, and other content that will appeal to each user's unique psychological profile.

"By tailoring our content to the individual, we can ensure that users spend more time on our site, click more ads, and
generate more revenue for our advertisers," Zuckerberg explained.

Many experts have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of the new algorithm, including the possibility
that it could undermine the very foundations of democracy.

"If people no longer have the ability to make free choices, then how can we have a functioning democracy?" asked
political scientist Dr. Emily Smith.

Despite these concerns, Zuckerberg remains optimistic about the future of Facebook and the impact his new algorithm will
have on the world.

"We believe that this technology has the potential to transform not just Facebook, but society as a whole," he said. "
And we're committed to making that vision a reality."

As of press time, Facebook users were reportedly already experiencing a noticeable decrease in their ability to resist
clicking on sponsored content.

## Apple Unveils Revolutionary iPhone That Can Only Be Used Once

CUPERTINO, CA—In a move designed to both boost sales and frustrate customers, Apple executives unveiled a revolutionary
new iPhone Wednesday that can only be used once. The new device, dubbed the iPhone Useless, is expected to retail for
$1,200 and comes with a slew of features that experts are already calling “irritatingly innovative.”

The iPhone Useless comes with all the bells and whistles of its predecessors, including an advanced camera system,
facial recognition software, and a litany of apps that can only be used once and then disappear forever. However, the
phone is programmed to self-destruct after the user’s first call or text message, rendering the device completely
useless.

“We’ve always prided ourselves on being ahead of the curve when it comes to technology,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during
the company’s keynote address. “And with the iPhone Useless, we’re taking that innovation to a whole new level. This is

Yesterday, Amazon announced the release of a new Alexa device that will permanently record every word spoken in its
vicinity, with the goal of better understanding and monetizing user data.

According to an Amazon spokesperson, the new device represents a major step forward in the company's efforts to provide
personalized recommendations and advertising to its users.

"With this new device, we will be able to collect even more data on our users' preferences, interests, and behaviors,"
the spokesperson said. "This will allow us to deliver targeted ads and recommendations that are even more relevant to
their needs."

However, many privacy advocates are concerned about the implications of such a device, which could potentially be used
to spy on users and violate their privacy.

"This is a blatant violation of users' basic rights to privacy and security," said one advocate. "We urge Amazon to
reconsider this dangerous and irresponsible move."

Despite these concerns, Amazon says it is confident that users will embrace the new device and its many features.

"We believe that our customers will appreciate the convenience and value that this device provides," the spokesperson
said.

Whether or not users will be willing to sacrifice their privacy for the sake of convenience remains to be seen.

Either way, the new Alexa device is sure to spark debate and controversy in the coming weeks and months.

Stay tuned for updates as this story develops.

## Google Announces Plan to Replace All Human Workers with Robots

Google announced last month that it plans to replace all human workers with robots by 2025 at its Googleplex
headquarters.

The move is designed to increase efficiency and reduce labor costs, according to a company spokesperson.

The robots will be able to perform a wide range of tasks, from coding and data analysis to customer service and
maintenance.

Google has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence and robotics in recent years, and the company believes that
this move will give it a significant competitive advantage.

However, critics have raised concerns about the impact that this will have on human workers, who will be left without
jobs or income.

Unemployment rates are already high, and some experts predict that the widespread adoption of robots in the workplace
could lead to even greater economic inequality.

Despite these concerns, Google remains committed to its plan, and the company is confident that it will be successful in
its efforts to replace all human workers with robots.

Time will tell whether this move will pay off in the long run, but for now, it seems that Google is determined to push
ahead with its plans.

As one company spokesperson put it, 'We believe that robots are the future, and we're excited to be at the forefront of
this exciting new technology.'

Only time will tell whether this is a bold new step forward for the company, or a misguided gamble that could have
disastrous consequences for everyone involved.

## Elon Musk's Plan to Colonize Mars: A One-Way Trip for 1 Million People

Last year, Elon Musk unveiled his ambitious plan to colonize Mars by sending 1 million people on a one-way trip to the
red planet. The plan, announced at SpaceX headquarters, is part of Musk's vision to ensure the survival of the human
race and expand his business empire.

According to Musk, the first step in the colonization process will be to establish a propellant plant on Mars that can
produce fuel for return trips. This will require a massive investment, but Musk is confident that it will pay off in the
long run.

Once the propellant plant is up and running, Musk plans to send a fleet of SpaceX's reusable rockets to Mars, each
carrying about 100 people and supplies for the new colony.

Musk acknowledged that the one-way trip may not appeal to everyone, but he believes that there will be plenty of
volunteers. "There's a certain romance to the idea of being one of the first people to set foot on a new world," he
said.

The journey to Mars will be long and dangerous, but Musk is confident that the passengers will be up for the
challenge. "We'll provide them with everything they need to survive and thrive on Mars," he said.

Once the colony is established, Musk plans to continue sending people and supplies to Mars on a regular basis. "We're
not just going to send 1 million people and call it a day," he said. "We're going to keep going until we've established
a thriving civilization on Mars."

Of course, Musk's plan has its critics. Some have questioned the feasibility of establishing a colony on Mars, while
others have raised ethical concerns about sending people on a one-way trip. But Musk remains undeterred.

"We're going to do this, and we're going to do it right," he said. "We're going to ensure the survival of the human race
and expand our business empire to new horizons."

In the end, only time will tell whether Musk's plan to colonize Mars is a success. But for now, it's clear that the
visionary billionaire is not afraid to dream big and take bold risks.
