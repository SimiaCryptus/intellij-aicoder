# Moral

After analyzing the plot, I would say that the moral of the story is that everyone has their own struggles and secrets, and we should be compassionate and understanding towards others, even if we don't know what they're going through. Additionally, we should be honest with ourselves and confront our own personal demons in order to grow and overcome our own challenges. Finally, when faced with adversity, we should come together and support each other, as we are stronger as a community than we are as individuals.
