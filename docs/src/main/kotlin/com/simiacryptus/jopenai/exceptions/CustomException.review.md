# Code Review for CustomException Class

## 1. Overview

This code defines a simple custom exception class named `CustomException` in the package `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions`. The class extends the standard `Exception` class and takes a message as a parameter.

## 2. General Observations

The code is concise and follows Kotlin's syntax for defining a class.

## 3. Specific Issues and Recommendations

1. Limited Exception Information
   - Severity: üòê Moderate
   - Type: üí° Idea
   - Description: The current implementation only allows for a message to be passed to the exception. In some cases, it might be useful to include additional information or a cause.
   - Recommendation: Consider adding optional parameters for a cause (Throwable) and/or additional properties to provide more context when the exception is thrown.
   - File: CustomException.kt, line 3

2. Missing Documentation
   - Severity: üòä Minor
   - Type: üìö Documentation
   - Description: The class lacks documentation explaining its purpose and usage.
   - Recommendation: Add KDoc comments to describe the class's purpose and any specific use cases.
   - File: CustomException.kt, line 3

## 4. Code Style and Best Practices

The code follows Kotlin's style guidelines. The class name is in PascalCase, which is appropriate for Kotlin classes.

## 5. Documentation

There is no documentation for this class. Adding KDoc comments would improve its usability and maintainability.

## 6. Performance Considerations

No significant performance concerns for this simple exception class.

## 7. Security Considerations

No immediate security concerns for this exception class.

## 8. Positive Aspects

The code is concise and follows Kotlin's syntax for defining a custom exception.

## 10. Conclusion and Next Steps

1. Add KDoc Documentation
   - Description: Add KDoc comments to describe the class's purpose and usage
   - Priority: Medium
   - Owner: [Assign appropriate team member]
   - Deadline: [Set appropriate deadline]

2. Consider Expanding Exception Information
   - Description: Evaluate the need for additional context in the exception and implement if necessary
   - Priority: Low
   - Owner: [Assign appropriate team member]
   - Deadline: [Set appropriate deadline]

Overall, the `CustomException` class is a simple and straightforward implementation. The suggested improvements are minor and aimed at enhancing documentation and potentially providing more context when the exception is used.
