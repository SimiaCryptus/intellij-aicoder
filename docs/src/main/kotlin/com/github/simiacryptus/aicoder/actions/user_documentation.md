# ApplyPatchAction.kt

Here's the user documentation for the ApplyPatchAction class:


## Apply Patch Action


### Overview
The Apply Patch action allows you to apply patch content to one or more selected files in your project. This is useful when you want to make changes to files using patch format rather than direct edits.


### Usage

1. Select one or more files in your project that you want to apply the patch to
2. Right-click and select "Apply Patch" from the context menu (or use the assigned shortcut if configured)
3. In the dialog that appears, enter or paste the patch content
4. Click OK to apply the patch


### Details

- The action will apply the same patch content to all selected files
- The patch should be in a standard patch/diff format
- If the patch cannot be applied cleanly, the operation will fail
- Changes are applied within a write command action to ensure proper undo/redo functionality
- The action runs in the background thread to avoid blocking the UI


### Requirements

- One or more files must be selected in the project
- You must have write permissions for the selected files
- The project must be open
- Valid patch content must be provided


### Tips

- Make sure your patch content is properly formatted before applying
- Test patches on a backup copy first if you're unsure about the changes
- Use version control to track changes and revert if needed
- The patch dialog supports multiline input for complex patches


### Error Handling

The action includes several safeguards:
- Validates project and file selection
- Requires non-empty patch content
- Executes changes in a write command action for safety
- Changes can be undone using standard IDE undo functionality

# OpenWebPageAction.kt

Here's the documentation for the OpenWebPageAction class:


## OpenWebPageAction

A simple action that opens a specific web page in the user's default browser.

### Implementation
The action is implemented as a simple override of `actionPerformed()` that calls the browse utility with a fixed URI.


### Dependencies
- Requires `com.simiacryptus.aicoder.util.BrowseUtil` for browser handling
- Uses Java's `URI` class for URL representation


### Example
```kotlin
// The action will be triggered automatically by the IDE when the user activates it
val action = OpenWebPageAction()

## DescribeAction Documentation


### Overview
The DescribeAction is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin action that generates natural language descriptions of selected code snippets. It helps developers understand code by providing human-readable explanations of what the code does.


### Features
- Automatically detects the programming language of the selected code
- Generates descriptions in the user's configured human language
- Formats the description as appropriate code comments (line or block comments)
- Preserves code indentation
- Works with any programming language supported by IntelliJ IDEA


### Usage
1. Select a block of code in the editor that you want to describe
2. Invoke the action through:
   - The context menu (right-click)
   - A keyboard shortcut (if configured)
   - The Actions menu

The action will:
1. Analyze the selected code
2. Generate a natural language description
3. Insert the description as a comment above the selected code
4. Preserve the original code indentation and formatting


### Requirements
- The action only works when there is text selected in the editor
- The file's programming language should be recognized by IntelliJ IDEA for optimal comment formatting


### Configuration
The action uses these settings from the plugin configuration:
- Human Language: The language used for generating descriptions
- Temperature: Controls the creativity/randomness of the generated descriptions
- Model: The AI model used for generating descriptions


### Example
```java
// This method calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion
public int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n-1);
}
```


### Notes
- The description format (line vs. block comments) is automatically chosen based on the length of the generated description
- Single-line descriptions use line comments
- Multi-line descriptions use block comments
- If the programming language is not recognized, the description will be inserted without comment formatting


### Error Handling
If an error occurs during description generation, an error message will be logged and the exception will be propagated to the user interface.
