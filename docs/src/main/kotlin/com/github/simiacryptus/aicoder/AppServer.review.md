# Code Review for AppServer.kt

## 1. Overview

This code defines an `AppServer` class responsible for setting up and managing a web server using Jetty. It's designed to handle WebSocket connections and serve web applications.

## 2. General Observations

- The code is well-structured and follows Kotlin conventions.
- It uses lazy initialization for several properties, which is good for performance.
- The server is designed to be singleton-like, with a companion object managing the instance.

## 3. Specific Issues and Recommendations

1. Potential Resource Leak
   - Severity: 😐
   - Type: 🐛
   - Description: The `progressThread` is started but never joined or interrupted, which could lead to a resource leak if the server is stopped externally.
   - Recommendation: Implement a proper shutdown mechanism for the `progressThread`.
   - File: AppServer.kt, line 58-72

2. Hardcoded Path
   - Severity: 😊
   - Type: 🧹
   - Description: The web app context path is hardcoded to "/".
   - Recommendation: Consider making this configurable, especially if multiple contexts might be needed in the future.
   - File: AppServer.kt, line 34

3. Error Handling
   - Severity: 😐
   - Type: 🐛
   - Description: There's no specific error handling for server start-up failures.
   - Recommendation: Implement proper error handling and logging for server start-up issues.
   - File: AppServer.kt, line 85

4. Thread Safety
   - Severity: 😐
   - Type: 🔒
   - Description: The `server` property in the companion object is not thread-safe.
   - Recommendation: Use `@Volatile` annotation or implement proper synchronization for the `server` property.
   - File: AppServer.kt, line 90-91

## 4. Code Style and Best Practices

- The code generally follows Kotlin best practices and conventions.
- Good use of lazy initialization and property delegation.
- Consistent naming conventions are used throughout the code.

## 5. Documentation

- 📚 The code lacks comprehensive documentation. Consider adding KDoc comments for the class and its main functions.
- 📚 The purpose and usage of the `AppServer` class should be clearly documented.

## 6. Performance Considerations

- 🚀 The use of lazy initialization is good for performance.
- 🚀 Consider implementing a connection pool if high concurrency is expected.

## 7. Security Considerations

- 🔒 Ensure that the server is properly configured for production use, including HTTPS support.
- 🔒 Validate and sanitize any user inputs, especially in the `SessionProxyServer`.

## 8. Positive Aspects

- The code is well-organized and easy to read.
- Good use of Kotlin features like lazy initialization and companion objects.
- The server implementation is flexible and can be easily extended.
