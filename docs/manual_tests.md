3. **Expected Result**: New tasks are added with unchecked boxes.


###### TC5: Empty and Null Item Handling
**Objective**: Verify how the action handles empty or null existing items.
1. Open a markdown file and create a list with empty items or simulate a scenario where the list API might return null.
2. Trigger the action.
3. **Expected Result**: The action should handle empty/null gracefully, either by ignoring them or by providing a default item text.


###### TC6: Error Handling
**Objective**: Test the action's robustness in handling errors from the list API.
1. Simulate an API failure or error response.
2. Trigger the action.
3. **Expected Result**: The action should not crash the IDE and should provide a meaningful error message.


###### TC7: Performance Test
**Objective**: Ensure that the action performs well with large lists.
1. Open a markdown file with a very large list (e.g., 100+ items).
2. Trigger the action.
3. **Expected Result**: The action should complete within a reasonable time without performance degradation.


###### TC8: Undo Functionality
**Objective**: Verify that the undo functionality works after the action is performed.
1. Perform any of the above test cases.
2. Use the IDE's undo feature.
3. **Expected Result**: The list should revert to its state before the action was triggered.


##### Post-Conditions:
- After testing, ensure no unwanted changes are saved in the markdown files unless specifically testing save functionality.


##### Reporting:
- All issues encountered should be documented with screenshots and detailed steps to reproduce. These should be reported to the development team for fixes.

This manual test plan will help ensure that the `MarkdownListAction` behaves as expected across different scenarios and markdown list formats.

#### Manual Test Plan for "Print Git Commit Patch" IntelliJ Plugin Action


##### Objective:
To verify that the "Print Git Commit Patch" action in the IntelliJ plugin correctly displays the patch information for a selected Git commit.


##### Pre-requisites:
- IntelliJ IDEA must be installed.
- The plugin containing the "Print Git Commit Patch" action must be installed and enabled.
- A project under Git version control must be opened in IntelliJ IDEA.


##### Test Environment:
- Operating System: [Specify OS - e.g., Windows 10, macOS Big Sur, etc.]
- IntelliJ IDEA Version: [Specify version - e.g., 2021.3]
- Plugin Version: [Specify version]


##### Test Data:
- A Git repository with multiple commits and branches for testing various scenarios.


##### Test Cases:

---


###### TC1: Basic Functionality Test
**Objective**: Ensure the action displays the correct patch for a selected commit.

**Steps**:
1. Open a project in IntelliJ that is under Git version control.
2. Right-click on a file in the Project Explorer and select 'Git' -> 'Show History'.
3. In the 'History' tab, select a commit that includes changes to the file.
4. Right-click on the selected commit and choose "Print Git Commit Patch".
5. Observe the output.

**Expected Result**:
- A dialog should appear displaying the patch information for the selected commit.

---


###### TC2: No Commit Selected
**Objective**: Verify the action handles the scenario where no commit is selected.

**Steps**:
1. Open a project in IntelliJ that is under Git version control.
2. Without selecting any commit, invoke the "Print Git Commit Patch" action (via any accessible means, such as a shortcut or command palette).

**Expected Result**:
- A dialog should appear with an error message "No commit selected."

---


###### TC3: No Project Open
**Objective**: Ensure the action is disabled when there is no open project.

**Steps**:
1. Close all projects in IntelliJ.
2. Attempt to invoke the "Print Git Commit Patch" action.

**Expected Result**:
- The action should be disabled and not executable.

---


###### TC4: Multiple Changes in a Single Commit
**Objective**: Verify that the action correctly handles commits with multiple file changes.

**Steps**:
1. Open a project in IntelliJ that is under Git version control.
2. Select a commit from the history that includes multiple file changes.
3. Invoke the "Print Git Commit Patch" action.

**Expected Result**:
- The dialog should display patch information for all changed files in the selected commit, separated by clear demarcations.

---


###### TC5: Action Visibility and Enablement
**Objective**: Confirm that the action is only visible and enabled when a project is open and a revision is selected.

**Steps**:
1. Open a project in IntelliJ and ensure no specific revision is selected.
2. Check the visibility and enablement of the "Print Git Commit Patch" action.

**Expected Result**:
- The action should be disabled and possibly hidden if no revision is selected.

---


##### Post-Test Cleanup:
- Close any open projects in IntelliJ.
- Restore any settings changed during testing to their original values.


##### Reporting:
- Document any discrepancies from the expected results and report them as issues in the issue tracker for the plugin development team to address. Include screenshots and detailed steps to reproduce the issue.
