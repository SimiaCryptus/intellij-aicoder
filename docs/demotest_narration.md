# Guidance and Best Practices for Narrating Demotests

## 1. Introduction

Narrating demotests is crucial for creating engaging and informative demonstrations of software features. This document provides guidelines and best practices to ensure consistent, clear, and effective narration across all demotests.

## 2. General Principles

### 2.1 Clarity
- Use simple, concise language
- Avoid technical jargon unless necessary
- Explain acronyms and technical terms when first used

### 2.2 Consistency
- Maintain a consistent tone and style across all demotests
- Use standardized phrases for common actions

### 2.3 Engagement
- Use an enthusiastic and positive tone
- Frame the demo as a journey of discovery

### 2.4 Pacing
- Speak at a moderate pace
- Pause briefly between major steps

## 3. Structure of Narration

### 3.1 Introduction
- Welcome the audience
- Briefly state the feature being demonstrated
- Set expectations for what will be shown

Example:
"Welcome to the AI Coder demo. We'll demonstrate the Code Chat feature."

### 3.2 Step-by-Step Narration
- Announce each major step before performing it
- Explain the purpose of each action
- Describe what's happening on the screen

Example:
"Now, we'll open a Kotlin file to start a code chat."

### 3.3 Highlighting Key Points
- Emphasize important features or benefits
- Explain the significance of certain actions or results

Example:
"Notice how quickly the AI generated a response. This can significantly speed up your workflow."

### 3.4 Handling Delays
- Acknowledge when waiting for processes to complete
- Use this time to provide additional context or benefits

Example:
"While we're waiting for the AI to generate a response, let me explain how this feature can improve code quality."

### 3.5 Conclusion
- Summarize what was demonstrated
- Reinforce the key benefits
- Thank the audience

Example:
"This concludes our AI Coder Code Chat demo. We've successfully initiated a Code Chat session for the selected code."

## 4. Best Practices

### 4.1 Use Active Voice
Prefer "We'll select the AI Coder option" over "The AI Coder option will be selected."

### 4.2 Be Descriptive
Describe visual elements and actions for those who might not be able to see the screen.

### 4.3 Anticipate Questions
Try to address potential questions in your narration before they arise.

### 4.4 Handle Errors Gracefully

### 4.5 Maintain Professionalism
Avoid using slang or informal language. Maintain a professional yet friendly tone.

### 4.6 Practice Inclusive Language
Use gender-neutral terms and avoid assumptions about the audience's technical knowledge.

## 5. Specific Phrases for Common Actions

- Opening menus: "Let's open the [menu name] menu."
- Selecting options: "We'll choose the [option name] option."
- Entering text: "Now, let's enter [description of text]."
- Waiting for processes: "We're waiting for [process description] to complete."
- Verifying results: "Let's verify that [expected result] has occurred."

## 6. Conclusion

Effective narration can greatly enhance the impact of demotests. By following these guidelines and best practices, you can create engaging, informative, and professional demonstrations that effectively showcase the features of the AI Coder plugin.
