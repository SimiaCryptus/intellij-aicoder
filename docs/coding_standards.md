# Coding Standards Document for Kotlin and Action Development

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices derived from the provided Kotlin code examples. It aims
to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.

## General Principles

1. **Consistency**: Adhere to the established coding conventions and patterns throughout the project.
2. **Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand by others, including proper naming and commenting.
3. **Maintainability**: Write modular, reusable code with clear separation of concerns to facilitate future updates and
   maintenance.

## Naming Conventions

- **Classes and Interfaces**: Use PascalCase and be descriptive. Example: `StaticAppSettingsConfigurable`.
- **Functions and Variables**: Use camelCase and be descriptive. Example: `buildComponent`.
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE. Example: `API_PROVIDER`.
- **Packages**: Use lowercase and avoid underscores. Example: `com.github.simiacryptus.aicoder.util`.

## Formatting

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation, not tabs.
- **Braces**: Place opening braces on the same line as the statement and closing braces on their own line.
- **Line Length**: Aim to keep lines under 120 characters for better readability.
- **Spacing**: Use spaces after commas, colons, and semicolons. Avoid spaces before commas.

## Comments and Documentation

- **Function Comments**: Document all public functions with KDoc, explaining purpose, parameters, return values, and
  exceptions.
- **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments sparingly to explain complex logic or decisions that aren't immediately
  clear.
- **TODOs**: Mark incomplete or temporary code with `TODO` comments, including a brief description.

## Error Handling

- Use try-catch blocks for error handling and log exceptions using a project-specific logger.
- Avoid swallowing exceptions unless absolutely necessary. If an exception is caught and not rethrown, document the
  reason.

## Kotlin-Specific Practices

- **Null Safety**: Leverage Kotlin's null safety features. Use nullable types (`?`) and safe calls (`?.`) appropriately.
- **Data Classes**: Use data classes for simple data holding objects.
- **Extension Functions**: Use extension functions to add functionality to existing classes without inheritance.
- **Scope Functions**: Use scope functions (`let`, `apply`, `run`, `with`, `also`) for more concise and readable code,
  especially when working with nullable types or initializing objects.

## UI Development

- **Layout Management**: Use appropriate layout managers to handle component layout in a flexible and responsive manner.
- **Event Handling**: Use lambda expressions or function references for concise event listener implementation.
- **Component Initialization**: Initialize UI components in a separate function or block to keep the UI code organized.

## Action Development

- **Action Registration**: Register actions in the appropriate action groups and ensure they are correctly enabled or
  disabled based on the context.
- **Background Tasks**: Use background threads for long-running tasks to keep the UI responsive. Ensure thread safety
  when accessing shared resources.
- **Logging**: Use a consistent logging approach across actions for debugging and error reporting.

## Version Control

- **Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages that describe the changes and their purpose.
- **Code Reviews**: Submit all changes for code review before merging to ensure adherence to standards and catch
  potential issues.

By following these coding standards and best practices, developers can contribute to a codebase that is clean,
efficient, and easy to work with.
