## Getting Started with AI Coding Assistant

Congratulations on installing the AI Coding Assistant! Let's get you set up and coding smarter in no time.

### Step 1: Obtain API Keys

To utilize the full power of AI Coding Assistant, you'll need API keys from one or more supported Language Model APIs.
Here are links to some popular providers where you can register and obtain your keys:

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
- [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/api)
- [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) - AWS Credentials are different from API keys. Instead, it is json that allows you to specify the profile and region. If no overrides are needed, just use `{}` to enable default AWS credentials.
- [Google](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup) - **PSST!** _Free For Now!_
