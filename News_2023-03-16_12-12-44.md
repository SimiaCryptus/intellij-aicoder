This discovery has raised questions about the ethics of studying and experimenting on animals. The scientists have stated that they will be more thoughtful in their future research endeavors.

## Local Man Uses Same Password Since 2003

Last week, a local man admitted to using the same password for all his online accounts since 2003.

When questioned about the security risks of such behavior, he responded that it was easy to remember.

Experts warn that using the same password for multiple accounts is a major security risk, as it makes it easier for hackers to gain access to sensitive information.

Furthermore, using a simple, easy-to-guess password like the one this man used only increases the likelihood of a security breach.

It is recommended that individuals use strong, unique passwords for each of their online accounts, and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.
