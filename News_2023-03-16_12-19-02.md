## Congress renames country 'The United States of McDonald's'

Today on Capitol Hill, Congress passed a bill to officially rename the country 'The United States of McDonald's.' The move comes as part of a larger effort to secure corporate sponsorship for the government.

While the decision has been met with mixed reactions, supporters argue that the move will bring much-needed revenue to the struggling nation. Critics, however, have expressed concern over the potential for undue influence from the fast food giant.

Regardless of the controversy, the name change will go into effect immediately. The new name will be reflected on all official documents and signage, and citizens are encouraged to use the new name in their everyday lives.

President Trump, who has long been a vocal supporter of McDonald's, praised the move on Twitter, calling it a 'smart business decision' and a 'win for America.'

Many are wondering what the future holds for the newly named country. Will other corporations follow suit and vie for their own piece of the American pie? Only time will tell.



## Senator Sanders Announces Plan to Nationalize All Ice Cream Shops

Senator Sanders has announced a bold plan to nationalize all ice cream shops across the country. The plan, which will be unveiled tomorrow in Brooklyn, aims to provide free ice cream for all.

According to sources close to the Senator, the plan has been in the works for months and is designed to address the rising cost of ice cream and the growing inequality in the ice cream market.

The plan would involve the government taking over all ice cream shops and running them as non-profit entities. This would allow the government to provide free ice cream to all citizens, regardless of their ability to pay.

The move has been met with both praise and criticism. Supporters of the plan argue that it is a necessary step to ensure that all Americans have access to one of the nation's favorite treats.

Opponents, however, argue that nationalizing ice cream shops would lead to inefficiencies and a decline in quality. They also question whether the government should be involved in the ice cream business at all.

Despite the criticism, Senator Sanders remains committed to the plan. In a statement released today, he said, "Ice cream is a right, not a privilege. It's time we start treating it as such."

The plan is set to be rolled out over the next 10 years, with the government gradually taking over ice cream shops across the country. It remains to be seen how the plan will be received by the public and whether it will ultimately be successful.

Regardless of the outcome, one thing is certain: ice cream will never be the same again.

## Tech Genius Invents Device That Makes People Smarter, Immediately Regrets It

Last week, a tech genius invented a device that promised to make people smarter in an instant. The inventor, whose identity is unknown, tested the device on himself and was amazed at the results.

He immediately put the device on the market, and people rushed to buy it. The device was easy to use and promised to increase intelligence by up to 50%. However, the inventor soon realized that he had not thought about the consequences of his invention.

After several days of use, people started to behave strangely. They became obsessed with learning and acquiring knowledge, and many of them stopped caring about anything else. The inventor realized that he had created a monster.

He immediately pulled the device from the market and tried to find a way to reverse its effects. However, it was too late. The device had already caused irreparable damage to the people who had used it.

The tech genius has since gone into hiding, and the device remains a mystery. Some say that he destroyed all evidence of its existence, while others believe that he is still working on a way to reverse its effects.

Whatever the case may be, the lesson is clear: technology must be used responsibly, and its consequences must be carefully considered before it is released into the world.

In the meantime, the people who used the device continue to struggle with their newfound intelligence, unable to return to their former selves.

The story of the tech genius and his ill-fated invention serves as a cautionary tale for us all, reminding us that we must always consider the consequences of our actions and the impact they will have on others.



## Silicon Valley Executive Develops AI That Can Do His Job, Realizes He Wasn't Doing Much Anyway

Last month, a Silicon Valley executive developed an AI that could do his job, only to realize that he wasn't doing much anyway.

The executive, who has asked to remain anonymous, said that he was motivated to create the AI to increase efficiency and productivity in his workplace.

The AI was able to automate many of the tasks that the executive had previously been responsible for, leaving him with a lot of free time on his hands.

"I thought I was indispensable," the executive said. "But it turns out that most of what I was doing could be done by a machine."

The executive said that he now plans to use his newfound free time to explore new opportunities and to learn more about the potential applications of AI in other industries.

"I'm excited to see what the future holds," he said.

The story has sparked a debate about the impact of AI on the job market and the role of humans in the workplace.

Some experts say that AI will ultimately lead to the creation of new jobs, while others worry that it will lead to widespread unemployment.

Regardless of the outcome, it seems clear that AI is rapidly changing the way we work and live.

Only time will tell what the future holds for the executive and others in his position.



## Teenage Hacker Shuts Down Government Website For Fun, Regrets It Immediately

Last year, a teenage hacker decided to show off his skills by shutting down a government website.

At first, he thought it was all in good fun. He was impressed with himself for being able to take down such a large website.

However, his excitement was short-lived. As soon as he realized the consequences of his actions, he regretted what he had done.

He knew that he had broken the law and could face serious repercussions for his actions.

The teenager quickly reached out to the government agency responsible for the website and offered his assistance in fixing the problem.

Thankfully, the agency was able to restore the website quickly and no sensitive information was compromised.

The teenager learned a valuable lesson that day about the power of his actions and the importance of using his skills for good.

While he may have initially wanted to show off, he ended up regretting his decision and realizing the potential harm he could have caused.

Hopefully, this experience will encourage him to use his skills in a more positive way in the future.

In the end, it's important to remember that with great power comes great responsibility.
