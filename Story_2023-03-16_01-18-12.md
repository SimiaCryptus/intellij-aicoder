The Wizard: Who goes there?!

Timmy: *gulp*

The Wizard: I've been expecting you, Timmy. You're not the first to try and steal from me.

Timmy: I'm sorry, Mr. Wizard. I just wanted to show off the crystal to my friends.

The Wizard: Stealing is never the answer, Timmy. You should know better.

Timmy: I do know better now. I'm sorry for what I did.

The Wizard: Apology accepted. Now, let's see if we can't find a way to get you out of here without triggering any more traps.

Timmy: *gulp* What other traps do you have in store for me?

The Wizard: You'll just have to find out, won't you?

Timmy: Oof! *thud* Ow! *thud* This staircase is so slippery! I can't seem to get a grip!

The Wizard: *chuckles* I see you're having some trouble, Timmy. Maybe you should have thought twice before trying to steal from me.

Timmy: I can do this! *slips* Whoa! *thud* Maybe not...

The Wizard: You know, Timmy, I could help you up if you promise to never try to steal from me again.

Timmy: *sigh* Okay, okay. I promise. Just please help me up!

Timmy: I'm sorry, Wizard. I didn't mean to cause any trouble. I just wanted to show off the crystal to my friends.

The Wizard: I understand, Timmy. But you must remember that taking things that don't belong to you is wrong. Now, let's get you cleaned up and we'll have a little chat.

Timmy: I'm sorry, Wizard. I just wanted to show off the crystal to my friends. I didn't mean any harm.

The Wizard: That's no excuse, Timmy. Taking things that don't belong to you is wrong. You need to learn to respect other people's property.

Timmy: I know, Wizard. I won't do it again, I promise.

The Wizard: I hope not, Timmy. Now, let's get you cleaned up and I'll make you some tea. We can talk about this more calmly.
